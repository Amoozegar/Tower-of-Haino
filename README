This piece of Python code, I calculated the mean and standard deviation of the center of mass for disks in Hanoi tower.
A Tower of Hanoi setup consists of N disks, weighing 1,…,N1,…,N kilos. Each disk sits in one of MM stacks, at positions 0,…,M−10,…,M−1. All disks start stacked at position zero, ordered by weight with the lightest on top. At each point in time, a valid move can be made. A valid move consists of taking the top disk off of one of the stacks and moving it to the top of the stack to the immediate left or right (that is, at position one less or one greater than its current position), provided that the moved disk weighs less than all other disks at its destination stack. For eample, in a N=M=3N=M=3 problem with disks 1,2,31,2,3 at positions 0,1,20,1,2, respecitvely, the only valid moves are for disk 11 to move to position 11 and disk 22 to move to position 22. We choose moves uniformly at random amongst all valid moves at a given time. We are interested in the position of the center of mass after T moves.
